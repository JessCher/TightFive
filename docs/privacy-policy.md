TightFive is built to keep your data on your device. We do not collect, sell, or share personal data.

# What we collect
- Nothing. TightFive does not collect analytics, advertising identifiers, or account data.
- Any information you enter (such as a display name to be used on shared Bit Cards) is stored locally on your device and is not accessible to the developer.

# Where your data lives
- On-device: Your bits, setlists, notes, profile information, and recordings are stored locally on your device.
- Optional iCloud sync: If enabled, your data is stored and encrypted by Apple under your Apple ID. TightFive does not operate servers or access this data.


# Voice, Siri, and speech recognition
TightFive uses Apple’s built-in Siri and speech recognition capabilities to allow you to generate bits, transcribe voice-to-text, and drive our Cue Card based Stage Mode. Your voice input is processed by Apple under Apple’s Privacy Policy and Siri/Speech terms. TightFive does not receive or store your raw audio beyond what you record on-device for app features.
