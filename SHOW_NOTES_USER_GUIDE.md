# Show Notes Enhancement - User Guide

## What's New

Your Show Notes feature now includes **detailed bit-by-bit analysis** with flippable cards and a **dual rating system** that separates objective performance from subjective feeling.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Open a Performance
Navigate to **Show Notes** and tap any performance to open the detail view.

### Step 2: Review Your Setlist
Scroll down to the **Setlist** section. You'll see all your script blocks (bits and freeform content) displayed as cards.

### Step 3: Rate and Annotate Each Bit

#### Viewing the Bit Content (Front of Card)
- The **front** of each card shows the bit content
- Notice the **flip button** in the bottom-right corner
- If you've already rated or added notes, you'll see a **yellow dot indicator**
- The icon changes:
  - ⭐ **star.fill** = rated
  - 📝 **note.text** = not rated yet

#### Rating and Adding Notes (Back of Card)
1. **Tap the flip button** → Card flips with smooth 3D animation
2. **Rate the bit** → Tap 1-5 stars (tap again to remove rating)
3. **Add notes** → Tap the text area to write thoughts like:
   - "Killed with the college crowd"
   - "Need to speed up the delivery"
   - "Try alternate punchline: [your idea]"
   - "Lost the room here - cut it"
4. **Flip back** → Tap flip button to return to content

#### Tips for Bit Notes
- Capture **what worked** and **what didn't**
- Note **audience reactions** or **timing issues**
- Try different **punchline variations** to test
- Track **setup adjustments** that improved the bit
- Record **delivery notes** (pause longer, faster pace, etc.)

### Step 4: View Performance Ratings

After rating your bits, scroll down to the **Performance Rating** section:

#### 📊 "How it went" (Auto-calculated)
- Automatically averages all your bit ratings
- **Objective measure** of material performance
- Updates in real-time as you rate bits
- Shows "Rate bits above" if you haven't rated any yet

#### ❤️ "How it felt" (Manual)
- Your **subjective overall feeling** about the show
- Rate the vibe, energy, audience, venue experience
- Independent of individual bit performance
- Tap stars to set (1-5, tap again to remove)

### Step 5: Add Overall Show Notes
- Scroll to **Overall Show Notes** section
- Write general thoughts about the performance:
  - Venue atmosphere
  - Audience demographics
  - Your energy level
  - Technical issues
  - Overall experience
  - Things to remember for next time

## Why Two Rating Systems?

### "How it went" (Objective)
- **Data-driven**: Based on how each bit actually performed
- **Helps identify**: Which bits work, which need work
- **Useful for**: Material selection, setlist building, cutting weak bits

### "How it felt" (Subjective)  
- **Emotion-driven**: How YOU felt about the show
- **Captures**: Intangibles like crowd energy, your confidence, flow
- **Useful for**: Personal growth, identifying mental game patterns

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Great Material, Bad Venue**
- How it went: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (bits all worked)
- How it felt: ⭐⭐ (audience was cold, bad acoustics)

**Scenario 2: Rough Set, Good Growth**
- How it went: ⭐⭐ (material bombed)
- How it felt: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (learned a lot, stayed confident)

**Scenario 3: Perfect Alignment**
- How it went: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (everything landed)
- How it felt: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (you felt amazing)

## Performance List View

When browsing Show Notes, performances now display both ratings:

```
🏢 NYC Set - Jan 15, 2026
📍 Comedy Cellar
⏱️ 12:34
📊 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (how it went)
❤️ ⭐⭐⭐⭐   (how it felt)
```

## Best Practices

### During the Show
- **Mental notes**: Try to remember specific moments for each bit
- **Audience signals**: Note which bits got big laughs, silence, or groans

### After the Show
1. **Rate immediately** while it's fresh (do it in the car or green room)
2. **Start with bits** → Rate and annotate each one
3. **Then overall feeling** → Rate "How it felt"
4. **Finally overall notes** → Capture general thoughts
5. **Be honest** → This data helps you improve

### Over Time
- **Track patterns**: Do certain bits always work? Always bomb?
- **Venue-specific**: Does your style work better in clubs vs open mics?
- **Material evolution**: Watch bits improve as you refine based on notes
- **Self-awareness**: Notice the gap between objective and subjective ratings

## Workflow Integration

### Pre-Show Preparation
1. Open previous performance of same setlist
2. Review bit notes for delivery reminders
3. Check which bits scored well
4. Mentally prepare for weak spots

### Post-Show Analysis
1. Rate and annotate while memories are fresh
2. Identify patterns across multiple shows
3. Make decisions:
   - Which bits to keep/cut
   - Which need rewrites
   - Which are ready for recording

### Material Development
1. Try new punchlines and note results
2. Track which variations work best
3. Build confidence by seeing consistent ratings
4. Know when a bit is "done" (consistently high ratings)

## Data You'll Build

After multiple shows, you'll have:
- **Historical performance data** for every bit
- **Trend analysis** (is this bit improving or declining?)
- **Pattern recognition** (works for certain audiences, not others)
- **Confidence metrics** (objective proof your material is good)
- **Personal insights** (correlation between your feeling and actual performance)

## Privacy & Storage

- All ratings and notes stored locally on your device
- Syncs with iCloud if enabled
- Not shared or uploaded anywhere
- Full control over your performance data
