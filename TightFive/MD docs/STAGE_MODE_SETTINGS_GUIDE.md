## Sensitivity Guide

### Exit Phrase Sensitivity
- **30-50%**: Very lenient, might advance too quickly
- **50-70%**: Balanced, good for most situations ✅ (default: 60%)
- **70-90%**: Very strict, requires precise matches

### Anchor Phrase Sensitivity
- **30-50%**: Lenient confirmation ✅ (default: 50%)
- **50-70%**: Moderate confirmation
- **70-90%**: Strict confirmation, rare false positives

## Troubleshooting

### Cards advance too quickly
→ Increase **Exit phrase sensitivity** to 70-80%

### Cards never advance automatically
→ Decrease **Exit phrase sensitivity** to 40-50%
→ Check microphone permissions
→ Ensure you're speaking the exit phrases clearly

### Text too small on stage
→ Increase **Font size** to 48-56pt
→ Consider using **Yellow** text color for visibility

### Text too large (content gets cut off)
→ Decrease **Font size** to 28-32pt
→ Reduce **Line spacing** to 8-10pt

### Phrase feedback too distracting
→ Turn off **Show phrase feedback**

### Want smooth transitions
→ Enable **Animations**
→ Try different **Transition styles** (Slide recommended)

## Tips

1. **Test Before Performance**: Try different settings in rehearsal mode
2. **Lighting Matters**: Yellow text works best in bright stage lights
3. **Content Length**: Shorter cards = larger font, longer cards = smaller font (automatic)
4. **Manual Override**: Auto-advance ON doesn't disable manual swipes
5. **Save Presets**: Note your favorite settings for different venues

## Support

If Stage Mode doesn't launch:
1. Ensure setlist is marked "Finished" (not "In Progress")
2. Verify setlist has script content (script blocks or bits)
3. Grant microphone permissions in iOS Settings
4. Try restarting the app

Settings are stored locally and persist across app launches. No internet connection required!
