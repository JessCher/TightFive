# Stage Rehearsal Mode - User Guide

## What is Stage Rehearsal?

Stage Rehearsal is a practice mode that lets you test your Stage Mode setup **without recording**. It's like a dress rehearsal for your voice-controlled performance system.

## When to Use It

- 🎯 **Before your first show** - Build confidence with automatic cue cards
- 🔧 **Testing new material** - Verify anchor and exit phrases work
- 🎤 **Sound check** - Make sure your mic picks up your voice
- ⚙️ **Fine-tuning settings** - Adjust sensitivity based on real data
- 🔄 **After editing phrases** - Test that changes improved recognition

## How to Access

1. Open any setlist in **Run Through** mode
2. Look for the yellow **"Stage Rehearsal"** button (bottom-right)
3. Tap to launch

## What You'll See

### Main Screen

**Top Bar:**
- ⏱️ Session timer
- 🟢 "REHEARSAL" indicator
- 🎤 Audio level meter (shows if mic is working)

**Center:**
- Your cue cards (same as Stage Mode)
- Large, readable text

**Bottom:**
- 📊 Progress bar (shows your position)
- 🔵 **ANCHOR** detection card (blue) with confidence %

### What the Colors Mean

**Audio Level Meter:**

- ⚪ **Gray**: No audio detected

**Phrase Detection Cards:**
- **Bright + Pulsing**: Phrase just detected!

## During Rehearsal

### Read Your Material
Perform as you would on stage. The system will:
- ✅ Listen for your anchor phrases (confirms you started the bit)
- ✅ Listen for your exit phrases (triggers next card)
- ✅ Show real-time confidence scores
- ✅ Auto-advance when exit phrase detected

### Watch the Feedback
- **ANCHOR %**: Shows how well it recognized your opening
- **EXIT %**: Shows how well it recognized your ending
- Higher % = better recognition

### Manual Controls
- **Swipe left** ⬅️ = Next card
- **Swipe right** ➡️ = Previous card
- Use these if auto-advance doesn't work

## Audio Warnings

If you see:
- 🟠 **"Audio too low"** → Speak louder or move closer to mic
- 🟠 **"Audio too high"** → Move back from mic

## Ending Your Session

1. Tap **X** (top-left)
2. Choose **"View Analytics"**
3. Review your detailed report

## Tips for Success

### Before Rehearsal
- ✅ Choose a quiet location
- ✅ Use the same mic you'll use on stage
- ✅ Position mic 6-12 inches from your mouth
- ✅ Test audio level meter first (should be green)

### During Rehearsal
- ✅ Speak at performance volume/speed
- ✅ Say your material exactly as written
- ✅ Don't rush through phrases
- ✅ Watch the confidence scores in real-time

### After Rehearsal
- ✅ Review which cards had problems
- ✅ Edit problematic anchor/exit phrases
- ✅ Run another rehearsal to test improvements
- ✅ Adjust settings if needed (sensitivity, font size, etc.)

## Understanding Confidence Scores

**What they mean:**
- **80-100%**: Excellent - phrase will work on stage
- **60-79%**: Good - should work reliably
- **40-59%**: Okay - might work, consider improving
- **0-39%**: Poor - definitely needs better phrase

**If scores are low:**
1. Make phrases more distinctive (avoid common words)
2. Keep phrases 4-8 words long
3. Use phrases with unique rhythm/cadence
4. Avoid phrases that sound like other parts of your bit

## Common Issues

### "Auto-advance isn't working"
**Possible causes:**
- Exit phrase too generic
- Speaking too fast/unclear
- Background noise interfering
- Sensitivity set too high

**Solutions:**
- Check exit phrase confidence score
- Slow down delivery slightly
- Move to quieter location
- Lower sensitivity in Stage Mode Settings

### "Audio level stuck at 0%"
**Possible causes:**
- Microphone permission denied
- Wrong mic selected
- Mic hardware issue

**Solutions:**
- Check Settings → Privacy → Microphone
- Try different microphone
- Restart the app

### "Anchor phrase never detected"
**This is actually okay!** Anchor phrases are optional confirmation. As long as EXIT phrases work, you're good.

**But if you want better anchor detection:**
- Use more distinctive opening words
- Increase anchor sensitivity in settings
- Make sure you're saying the exact phrase

## What This WON'T Do

- ❌ Won't record your audio
- ❌ Won't create a performance in your history
- ❌ Won't generate show notes
- ❌ Won't affect your setlist

**It's purely for practice and feedback.**

## Settings That Affect Rehearsal

All your Stage Mode settings apply:
- Font size
- Text color
- Line spacing
- Auto-advance on/off
- Phrase feedback visibility
- Anchor/exit sensitivity
- Animations

**To adjust:** Go to setlist → ⋯ menu → "Stage Mode Settings"
